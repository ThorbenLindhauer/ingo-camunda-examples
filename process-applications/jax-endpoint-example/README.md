# Quick start for a JAX-RS endpoint

This project contains a start to build a JAX-RS endpoint, simply with hello world.

Have a look at the classes [HelloWorldApplication.java](src/main/java/com/camunda/consulting/jaxEndpointExample/webservice/HelloWorldApplication.java) and [HelloWorldResource.java](src/main/java/com/camunda/consulting/jaxEndpointExample/webservice/HelloWorldResource.java) to see the magic annotations.

After deploying with `mvn clean wildfly:deploy` you can access the helloworld in your browser:
[http://localhost:8080/jax-endpoint-example/resources/helloworld](http://localhost:8080/jax-endpoint-example/resources/helloworld).

This is a Process Application for [Camunda BPM](http://docs.camunda.org).

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-ejb-war-7.3.1](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

## How to use it?
You can download a Camunda BPM distribution for JBoss from the
[Camunda BPM download page](http://camunda.org/download/).

You can also use `ant` to build and deploy the example to an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).
